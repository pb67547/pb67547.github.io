	<p style="font-family:Comic Sans MS"><strong> I was born in Atlanta, Georgia on July 26, 1999. My family includes me, my mom, my dad, and my two older 
sisters. My dad is from Colombia and my mom is from South Georgia so I experienced different types of cultures  
growing up. When I was five, my family moved from Suwanee to Peachtree City. I stayed there until I graduated from
high school and went off to college. </strong></p>
	<H3 style="font-size:20px ; text-shadow: 2px 2px #FFFFFF"><b><br> Academics </b></h3>
	<p style="font-family:Comic Sans MS"><strong> I attended Starr's Mill High School in Fayetteville, Georgia. During my time at Starr's Mill, I was involved in 
several extra-curricular activites. I was the president of FBLA and captain of the varsity soccer team. I was also a member of Beta Club, National Honor 
Society, and Spanish Club. Upon graduating from Starr's Mill, I went on to attend the University
of Georgia which is where I currently live and study. I am majoring in Finance with hopes of being a financial planner one day! </strong></p>

	<H3 style="font-size:20px ; text-shadow: 2px 2px #FFFFFF"><b> Hobbies </b></h3>
	<p style="font-family:Comic Sans MS"><strong> I spend my free time doing various activites. I enjoy the outdoors whether it be hiking, camping, or rock-climbing. I'm 
always up for an adventure!	Music is another passion of mine. I absolutely love listening to music and going to concerts. Some 
of my favorite bands include The Lumineers, Mumford & Sons, and The Oh Hellos. I am also a sports fanatic. I bleed red and black so you can always find me supporting the 
<a href="http://www.georgiadogs.com/index.aspx?path=football">Georgia Bulldogs </a> on Saturdays! I also love playing all different types of sports like soccer and 
football. I played soccer all throughout high school and below is a list of my stats! </strong></p>
